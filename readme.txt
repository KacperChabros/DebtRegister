Before the first usage of the web application one should create a database using named "debtregister" and import the file named "StrucDataSample.sql" Personally I used Xampp. If this does not work with the view "leaderboard" please copy the code for this view from "debtRegisterCode.sql".

It is only sample data, the due dates from the future should not cause worry.
